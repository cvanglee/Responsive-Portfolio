      <p>Hi, I am Chong Lee.  I live in Hopkins, Minnesota.  I grew up in Oshkosh, Wisconsin with 7 brothers and two sisters.  My twin brother and I were right in the middle of our bunch.  Now I am married and have 4 wonderful children.  They range in age from 4 years old to 13 years old.</p>
            <p>I worked at Verizon Wireless for the last 15 years.  I started as an intern straight out of college and had that position for 6 months until I became an RF Engineer 1. As an RF Engineer 1, I worked with a lead engineer to design cell sites and maintain our network.  
            As I progressed to an engineer 2 and 3, I eventually designed and maintained capacity for my own market.  I did this for our southern Minnesota area which was just south of Northfield to the Iowa border and across from Wisconsin to South Dakota.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Then during my last 4 years with Verizon Wireless, I moved to the role of RF Planning Engineer 4.  This role consisted of putting together a budget for a market that consisted of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska.  
            I had to support the market by working with them to make sure they were using the budget allocated to them to maintain their markets to the standards.  I also project managed several projects to make sure they get completed by the end of the year.  
            I really enjoyed working for Verizon Wireless, but I felt like I need a change and decided to get into coding.</p>
